Tested on Win7 32bit

1) Download/install CMake 3.4.3
https://cmake.org/download/
(add cmake to system PATH for all/current users)

2) Download/install Visual Studio 2015
https://www.visualstudio.com/post-download-vs?sku=community&clcid=0x409
(VS Community 2015 w/Update 1 is free)
be sure to do custom install, and select VC++: Common tools for visual c++ 2015

2) Download geant4 10.02
http://geant4.web.cern.ch/geant4/support/download.shtml

3) Extract geant4_10_02.zip to some directory
(eg C:\geant4\)

4) Now generally follow the instructions in chapter 2.2 of:
http://gentoo.osuosl.org/distfiles/BookInstalGuide-4.10.1.pdf
This is for version 10.1 but will work just the same for 10.2
Always (!!) run cmake and visual studio as administrator (right-click --> run as admin)
NB: building geant4 takes a long (LONG) time
NB: When you choose the Generator, choose the correct architecture for VS 2015. If you have a 32bit system choose VS

5) Download the MilliQ repository:
https://github.com/talbert48/milliq
ie "git clone" or download as zip from the website
Put it somewhere convient (eg C:\geant4\milliq-master\milliq-master\)

6) Make a build folder
(eg C:\geant4\milliq-build\)
Follow the instructions in chapter 3.2.1.2 of http://gentoo.osuosl.org/distfiles/BookInstalGuide-4.10.1.pdf
except for milliq instead of ExampleB1
The source directory for cmake is something like C:\geant4\milliq-master\geant4\

7) Download the physics data:
https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0ByB-4FDSD9R6WGptS0kxTjhkU1U&usp=sharing
unzip it somewhere convenient
(eg C:\geant4\acceptances_v3\)

Edit milliq-master\milliq-master\geant4\src\MilliQPrimaryGeneratorAction.cc
on line 205, change the path to where you put the data:
std::string pathname="C:\\geant4\\acceptances_v3\\mCP_UFO\\";

Build MilliQ again in VS.

8) Now to run, copy milliq-master\RootAnalysis\mcp.mac into milliq-build\Release
Also copy milliq-build\*.mac into milliq-build\Release
You can edit vis.mac to use OGLSWin32 instead:
/vis/open OGLSWin32

9) Finally run milliq-build/Release/MilliQ.exe as admin
